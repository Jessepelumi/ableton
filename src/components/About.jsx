            self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects
            us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge
            to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music

            of perspectives. We don't always agree with each other, but opinion

            Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively
            supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on
            applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized
            development and music salons are a chance to discuss new
